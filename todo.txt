ok now something is very wrong with playing audio:
1) when I click the green play button on the transport area it doesnt play all tracks at the same time
2) when I click the stop button on the transport it doesnt move the red bar to the start
3) there isn't any thin red line all over the timeline just on the top beats columns
4) I can't hover the volume bar and its zindex is under things
5) when I upload files they start to play right away I dont want it
6) when I manually play the files from the tracks the button stays on pause instead of going back to play when the track finished playing
7) when I manually play a track a red line spawns inside the track that doesnt follow the play time but there is already a way for the track to show its playing state when I just drag it on the page it does it, there is already something that follow the playing progress instead of the red thing
1) you can't play audio
2) the grid is messed up compared to the track list
3) track should not have microphone
4) track should have a user profile (contributor)
5) the audio files should be in a box that you can drag around the tracks and timeline
6) cutting audios files
7) place files by left clicking
8) right click delete files
9) can only move files not vertically
10) timeline should not be by seconds it should be by beats
11) upvotes for contributions

(Contributions work like this, users can mute, delete edit, and add tracks, when they are done they click “submit” and that users version of the project is played when a user hovers selects it)

After a arbitrary timer, When owner accepts new changes to the project. Giving time to people to make contributions without the project moving to rapidly so that you can’t change things

The playhead in my audio editing software is not playing any audio. The playhead moves, but there is no sound. when i click pause the playhead should stop where it is currently and not reset, also there should be a reset playhead button which is just a "stop" button, so a play pause and stop
